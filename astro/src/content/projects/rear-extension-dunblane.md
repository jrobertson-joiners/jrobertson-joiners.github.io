## Project Overview

*This is a placeholder project. Real project details coming soon.*

This single-storey rear extension added approximately 25 square metres to a 1970s family home, creating a spacious open-plan kitchen-diner with views over the garden.

### Scope of Work

- Planning application and Building Warrant
- Groundworks and foundation construction
- Timber frame extension build
- Flat roof with lantern light
- Bi-fold doors to garden
- Structural opening into existing house
- New kitchen installation
- Underfloor heating coordination
- Internal finishings and decoration

### The Result

The extension transformed the back of the house, creating a light-filled family space that flows seamlessly into the garden. The new kitchen provides ample storage and worktop space, with a central island perfect for casual dining and homework supervision.
