## Our Home – Built From the Ground Up

This is our own home – we built it ourselves. As a joiner-led project, we took pride in every detail, from the structural work right through to the final finishes.

### Custom Staircase

The centrepiece of the house is the bespoke staircase, designed and built entirely in-house. Every tread, riser, and baluster was carefully crafted to create a feature that's both functional and beautiful.

### Joinery Finishes Throughout

Throughout the property, you'll find examples of quality joinery work:

- Custom-built kitchen with hand-finished cabinets
- Fitted wardrobes and storage solutions
- Interior doors and architraves
- Skirting boards and window surrounds
- Feature built-in shelving

### A True Showcase

Building our own home gave us the opportunity to showcase what's possible when you have complete creative freedom. Every element was considered, from the initial design through to the finishing touches.

This project represents the standard of work we bring to every job – attention to detail, quality materials, and craftsmanship you can see and feel.
