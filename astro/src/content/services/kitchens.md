## Expert Kitchen Fitting in Stirling

Transform your kitchen with precision joinery and professional installation. We specialise in fitting kitchens of all styles and sizes across Stirling and the wider Central Scotland area.

### What We Offer

Our kitchen installation service covers everything from simple cabinet replacements to full kitchen renovations:

- **Cabinet fitting and assembly** – Precise installation of base units, wall units, and tall storage
- **Worktop templating and fitting** – Solid wood, laminate, and stone worktops cut and fitted to perfection
- **Appliance integration** – Seamless installation of built-in ovens, hobs, dishwashers, and refrigeration
- **Storage solutions** – Clever pull-out systems, corner units, and custom pantry configurations
- **Finishing touches** – Plinths, cornices, lighting pelmets, and decorative end panels

### Our Approach

Every kitchen installation starts with a detailed site survey. We'll check measurements, discuss your layout preferences, and identify any preparatory work needed before the new units arrive.

On installation day, we work methodically through each element, ensuring every unit is level, every door is aligned, and every drawer runs smoothly. We coordinate with electricians and plumbers when needed, so you have one point of contact throughout.

### Why Choose Us

- Detail-focused joiners with years of kitchen fitting experience
- Friendly, tidy workmanship from first visit to final handover
