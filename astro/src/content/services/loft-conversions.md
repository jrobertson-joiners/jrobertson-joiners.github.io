## Loft Conversions in Stirling & Central Scotland

Unlock the hidden potential in your home with a professionally designed and built loft conversion. As joinery-led building contractors, we handle the structural timber work, internal finishings, and multi-trade coordination to deliver a finished space that adds real value to your property.

### Types of Loft Conversion

We work with all common loft conversion styles to suit your property and budget:

- **Velux/Rooflight conversions** – The simplest option, adding roof windows without changing the roofline
- **Dormer conversions** – Extended sections that create more headroom and floor space
- **Hip-to-gable conversions** – Ideal for semi-detached and detached properties with hipped roofs
- **L-shaped dormers** – Maximise space on larger properties with rear and side extensions

### What's Included

Our loft conversion service typically covers:

- Initial survey and feasibility assessment
- Structural calculations and Building Warrant applications
- Floor strengthening and staircase installation
- Dormer construction and roofing (if applicable)
- Insulation to current Building Regulations standards
- Electrical first-fix and lighting layout
- Plasterboard lining and finishing
- Internal doors, skirtings, and architraves
- Coordination of plumbing for en-suite if required

### Our Process
