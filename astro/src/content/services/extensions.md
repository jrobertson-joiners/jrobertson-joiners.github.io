## Home Extensions in Stirling & Central Scotland

Need more space? A well-designed extension can transform how you live, adding valuable square footage while enhancing your property's appeal. As joinery-led building contractors, we manage the entire process from initial designs through to final handover.

### Types of Extension

We design and build a wide range of home extensions:

- **Single-storey rear extensions** – Open-plan kitchen-diners, garden rooms, and utility spaces
- **Side return extensions** – Make use of narrow passageways on terraced and semi-detached properties
- **Wrap-around extensions** – Combine rear and side extensions for maximum impact
- **Two-storey extensions** – Add bedrooms, bathrooms, and living space over multiple floors
- **Garage conversions** – Transform unused garage space into functional living areas

### Our Full-Service Approach

As your building contractor, we handle:

- **Planning and permissions** – Planning applications and Building Warrant submissions
- **Design development** – Working with architects or providing our own technical drawings
- **Groundworks and foundations** – Coordination with trusted groundworkers
- **Structural work** – Timber frame, steels, and load-bearing alterations
- **Roofing** – Flat roofs, pitched roofs, and lantern lights
- **Windows and doors** – Supply and installation of quality frames
- **Internal finishings** – Joinery, plastering, and decoration
- **Electrical and plumbing** – Through our network of trusted tradespeople

### Why a Joinery-Led Contractor?

Extensions involve significant timber work – roof structures, floor joists, stud walls, door frames, and finishing carpentry. With joinery at the heart of what we do, you get craftsman-quality work on the elements that matter most for the look and feel of your new space.

### Get Started

Every extension project starts with an informal chat. We'll visit your property, discuss your ideas, and provide honest advice on what's achievable within your budget.
